            <p class="style1">
                I really like learning about security in any sort of way. I look forward
                to taking security courses as part of this major as it was one of the
                main reason I picked the major. Learning about different ways hackers
                exploit machines and different ways security has evolved pique my interest.
                I also enjoy learning coding even if I am not currently proficient at it.
                To me, making websites and features such as log in page are super cool.

            <h2>Current Thoughts</h2>
            <p class="style1">
                So far, I really like the University of Washington Tacoma. I met a lot of good
                people as well as learned a lot of things from my professors. Overall, there
                is no regret from me when I chose to go here instead of attending a different
                college. Since I am still in Junior year, my mind is still set on trying to
                get into the cybersecurity field. It was the inital field that interested me the
                most because I love learning about how the internet works.
